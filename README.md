# budgeting_helper
A simple budgeting script where the main.py file imports the functions/methods from budget.py. Main.py is where you would enter your budget for the week or month, and enter in
all the withdrawals/deposits/transfers for each category for the week or month. The current main.py script serves as a template as to how to do this. Running the main.py script
once the necessary values have been put in yields an expenditure summary, and a simple bar chart that display all expenditure across all categories for the month/week as shown in the files in the sample_results folder.
